Its-a-match was a team project ,aimed to provide a to provide a provide a platform where users could could interact and explore.The main idea was to come up with a fun interface specifically aimed for MNNIT students in the beginning.Functionally ,users coud like a person and start a private conversation with them or explore further.Every user had a personalised feed,where the posts and pictures of liked people was available.Apart from this the recommendation part of the feed was done using a small but fun questionnaire that users had to fill at the time of sign up.

Coming to technicalities,MERN stack was used as the backbone of the project where MongoDB was used  as a primary database. Chat functionality was achieved using SOCKET.io while external third party platforms were used for storage of content.

As of now ,we are looking forward to make our platform more interactive where users could video call each other without compromising on their privacy and safety.We are also thinking towards adding more verification methods ont the platform so as to counter fake profiles.
